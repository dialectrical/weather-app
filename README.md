# Weather App project

I made this project in order to practice working with APIs in React.

## How I worked on this project

- `create-react-app` was used to bootstrap the project
- `Axios` was used to handle API requests
- `Material-UI` components were used
- `weatherbit.io`'s API was used to get weather data

## Future goals

- Display more API information
- Allow looking up weather info from other kinds of input accepted by the API
